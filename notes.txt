a block can contain n number of transaction, decided by block size. 
Bitcoin has 2000 but different chains can have different size. 

Each block has an index, timestamp, transactions, (sender, receiver, amount), 
proof and previous blocks hash-->this is what gives blockchain immutability. 

block = {
    'index': 1,
    'timestamp': 1506057125.900785,
    'transactions': [
        {
            'sender': "8527147fe1f5426f9dd545de4b27ee00",
            'recipient': "a77f5cdfa2934df3954a5c7c7da5df1f",
            'amount': 5,
        }
    ],
    'proof': 324984774000,
    'previous_hash': "2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824"
}

If one block is corrupted, all blocks will have wrong hashes. 

-------
adding transactions to the block 

---
Creating new blocks

when the block chain is instantiated, we need to seed it to the GENESIS block,
GENESIS block is one with no predecessors. 
We also need to add proof (proof of work for the mining) to the genesis block.
