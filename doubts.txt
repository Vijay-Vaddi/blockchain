proof of work clearity. 
how's the network able to verify the solution? 

# generate a globally unique address for this code. (?)
node_identifier = str(uuid4()).replace('-','')

/mine GET request is creating new block, 
and transactions/new POST creates new transactions,
so when does a new blocks gets added if just transactions keep happening?
auto mine once the trax[] is full?

can a block have different trax count?
